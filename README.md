# sales-data-analysis

Background:

The dataset is a great way to understand the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis and basic data cleaning.

About the dataset:

The dataset consists of 11 columns, each column representing an attribute of purchase on a product -
Order ID - A unique ID for each order placed on a product
Product - Item that is purchased
Quantity Ordered - Describes how many of that products are ordered
Price Each - Price of a unit of that product
Order Date - Date on which the order is placed
Purchase Address - Address to where the order is shipped
Month, Sales, City, Hour - Extra attributes formed from the above.  

Preparation:

The preparation includes a glace to the data, finding and cleaning anomalies manually first, and understanding what type of data is given, to get a brief idea as to how it can be analysed.

Process:

The first step involves importing the data into the Python notebook, and importing all the necessary libraries that will be useful for analysis. The libraries used for this project are : pandas, numpy and plotly

The next step involves deriving a brief statistics, and removing further anomalies, if any.

After these two steps, the analysis of the data is kickstarted.

Analysis:

The analysis includes % sales of each product. The result of the analysis can help in determining which products need more marketing, which needs to be discontinued and which products should be focused more on.

The top 5 cities with the most sales is an important aspect for analysis. It helps to determine which cities are doing good in terms of sales and in which cities the business needs to be focused more on or shutting down to cut down the costs.

Analysing hourly and monthly sales helps us determine which months of the year needs more focus and the store hours, i.e. the opening and closing hours.

Challenges:

The challenges faced during the analysis were firstly, being my first project, the creativity couldn't be unleashed with the nervousness of analysing something unnecessary statistic.
